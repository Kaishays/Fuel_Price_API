# FuelSaver - API-Based Fuel Price Comparison Tool 

FuelSaver is a personal project aimed at helping users save money on fuel by providing real-time information using the TomTom Fuel Price API. The problem with many other fuel price trackers is poor coverage of fuel stations or that they are based on the credibility of other fuel station users. The benefit of using an API-based tool is that it provides real-time comparisons of fuel costs.
